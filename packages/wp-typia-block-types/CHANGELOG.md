# @wp-typia/block-types

## 0.3.1 — 2026-05-16

### Patch changes

- [0eeb3580](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/0eeb3580f67c30e76fab321c2fd868dcb980ed6f) Split block binding source PHP and editor registration source generation into a
  focused internal codegen module while preserving the existing bindings facade. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [514b35d1](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/514b35d144aa2f9d5d465a3b8afee83540b97f4d) Make block-types diagnostic output explicit and silent by default. Non-strict
  warnings from Supports, Variations, and Bindings no longer fall back to
  `console.warn`; pass `onDiagnostic` for structured callbacks or `logger:
  console`/a custom logger for visible warning output. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [7378df6b](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/7378df6b11661385a3c2e3afd734db8fb185378b) Share static registration normalization, object-record checks, and diagnostic
  fallback helpers across block bindings, variations, and supports internals. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.3.0 — 2026-05-15

- [256423d6](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/256423d665da8ab8ded84e22007e34f6bbf06997) Add typed defineVariation() and defineVariations() helpers with validation diagnostics and static JavaScript registration source generation. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [8a47bfc5](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/8a47bfc5e95cf42a42e1fc5765061b6139b832d3) Add defineSupports() and SupportAttributes helpers for typed WordPress Block Supports authoring with version-aware compatibility diagnostics. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.2.4 — 2026-04-16

### Patch changes

- [8b661b9](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/8b661b9da8af050941789496064c51c25850ccd9) Added first-class validation coverage for `@wp-typia/block-types`, including
  published export-contract checks, compile-time public type fixtures, and CI
  coverage wiring so block type regressions fail fast before they leak to
  downstream packages. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.2.3 — 2026-04-15

### Patch changes

- [1c9916a](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/1c9916aa50c7e80590b35a7691b9f5fc0537ea60) Fixed published scaffold outputs so generated basic, persistence, and compound block registration files no longer rely on `registerBlockType<T>()` generic calls that break against the current published `@wordpress/blocks` type surface. Hardened the packed publish-install smoke to verify wrapper exports and to typecheck generated basic and compound scaffolds, including the compound `add-compound-child` path, against packed local release tarballs before publish. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.2.2 — 2026-04-15

### Patch changes

- [63657e2](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/63657e2182b5754aff7d40fc6218a247567c48a7) Own the generated block registration TypeScript surface in `@wp-typia/block-types`, and update scaffolds and reference examples to prefer the local registration facade over direct `@wordpress/blocks` type imports. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.2.1 — 2026-04-09

### Patch changes

- [ab7d1c9](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/ab7d1c9afaf4039b5053991ca9fe88cabcd46a13) Publish shared API client utilities and runtime primitives from `@wp-typia/api-client`, reuse them across rest and runtime packages, and align active package Bun minimums with `1.3.11`. — Thanks @imjlk!

- [a8d57c8](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/a8d57c8b5502c1862251038384512c316bf7ec72) Broaden `@wp-typia/block-types` support and style coverage with additional
  stable Core surfaces including `dropCap`, `backgroundImage`, `enableAlpha`,
  `spacingSizes`, `units`, `duotone`, per-side border widths, layout gaps, and
  the `js` / `locking` support keys. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [1f75a3f](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/1f75a3f20deae1ac13afb8c4ac9d6d2008773ff9) Add experimental `__experimentalSkipSerialization` typing for selected block
  support sections in `@wp-typia/block-types`, including a reusable
  `SkipSerialization<TFeature>` helper for Gutenberg-tracking server-style
  support metadata. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [00e148e](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/00e148e788160dd2564faeebc7fba530c037bce8) Add first-class WordPress block support metadata types and public style-support helper types, and teach the scaffold metadata pipeline to understand indexed-access support attributes and primitive-compatible intersections from `@wp-typia/block-types`. — Thanks @imjlk!

### Patch changes

### Patch changes

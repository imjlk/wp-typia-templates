- [cc55b61](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/cc55b61a42a02ee02020b337e10dd70d80c5caa0) Made external-template trust more explicit during scaffolding and surfaced clearer diagnostics when remote template package metadata is malformed. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [9866ae9](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/9866ae9fbfcea874ef948917ab4d8677521b7e0b) Treat `wp-typia add` without a subcommand kind as a real CLI error. The command now still prints add help text for interactive users, but exits non-zero so shells, CI, and wrappers can distinguish malformed invocations from successful add workflows. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.19.0 — 2026-04-21

### Minor changes

- [bd575b8](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/bd575b866ac7f7860ef2e25ab3a7663fc0e4a9d0) Add alternate render target scaffold support for persistence-capable dynamic blocks. `wp-typia create` and `wp-typia add block` now accept `--alternate-render-targets <email,mjml,plain-text>` for persistence scaffolds and persistence-enabled compound scaffolds, emitting shared `render-targets.php` helpers plus per-target render entry files alongside the default web render boundary. — Thanks @imjlk!

### Patch changes

- [0938059](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/0938059eba177cb446bd05554ba5cd0ed1a1b5b8) Unify high-frequency create/add validation paths around shared helpers so built-in `--variant` errors, `externalLayerId` composition rules, and local `--external-layer-source` path failures surface the same messages across CLI entry points. Query Loop post-type validation now mentions the original offending input, and `wp-typia add block` explains when a provided name normalizes to an empty slug instead of falling back to a generic required-field error. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [0559810](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/055981091f996d6693dcce323e191e1f879ae127) Improve create/add/sync CLI ergonomics for preview-first and no-install workflows. `wp-typia create --dry-run` now defaults non-interactive answers without requiring an extra `--yes`, `wp-typia sync` fails early with install guidance when local dependencies like `tsx` are missing, and `wp-typia add ... --dry-run` can preview planned workspace file updates without mutating the real workspace. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [6bcd154](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/6bcd1540a2e18f51e9b63f7c57f71fe2c4f33471) Trim the published `wp-typia` CLI tarball so Bunli/OpenTUI runtime assets stay under `dist-bunli/.bunli/` and repo-only build inputs like `bunli.config.ts` no longer ship to npm. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [d2d0cd6](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/d2d0cd61b22cf4f6086609d342d9cd9beec189f4) Polish scaffold onboarding so create-time output and generated READMEs make `wp-typia doctor` easier to discover, keep sync notes shorter, and favor the default workspace quick-start path over more specialized first-run examples. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [849c750](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/849c7502911954796dc1e8ae13c6369de658313b) Expose hook-friendly InnerBlocks option helpers for generated compound containers.
  
  Generated compound parents and container children now export reusable `get*InnerBlocksPropsOptions()` helpers so projects can move to `useInnerBlocksProps` without manually reconstructing preset-driven `template`, `defaultBlock`, `templateLock`, `orientation`, `directInsert`, or `renderAppender` settings. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [da4ea2c](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/da4ea2c40e34548c8931a48b47cf886fb76d014e) Clarify compound nested block ownership so static child constraints stay metadata-owned.
  
  Generated compound parent and nested child editors now rely on `block.json` for static `allowedBlocks`, `parent`, and `ancestor` relationships, while `children.ts` stays focused on editor-only preset behavior such as `template`, `defaultBlock`, `orientation`, `templateLock`, and `directInsert`. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [a22b87f](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/a22b87fc13bd4d882502b04dc591cc61d2146c58) Align Bunli command metadata with the Node fallback help and parser surfaces so `wp-typia --help`, command-specific fallback help, and end-user runtime guidance stay consistent as CLI flags evolve. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [b94f058](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/b94f058f79a967a31052d2c33a45b201a340d28e) Clarify template capability boundaries across create/add/help/onboarding flows. Query Loop discovery now explains that it is a create-time `core/query` variation scaffold rather than an `add block` family, explicit but inapplicable flags like `--with-migration-ui` and `--query-post-type` now surface visible warnings, and workspace guidance more consistently points users at the short `--template workspace` alias. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [b177c6b](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/b177c6b429753e7c05714efcdc0d66be980cb1f0) Validate compound child graphs before generated nested child scaffolds write files.
  
  Generated compound child add-flow scripts can now preview the resulting nested hierarchy with `--dry-run`, emit planned writes before mutating files, and fail early when existing or requested ancestor graphs are structurally invalid. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [4eb3ad0](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/4eb3ad064d6fa18839b7692bcb8ff6ac04e49091) Add compound scaffold InnerBlocks presets for richer nested authoring flows.
  
  Compound create and workspace add flows now accept `--inner-blocks-preset <freeform|ordered|horizontal|locked-structure>`, generated compound container code exposes preset-backed `orientation`, `templateLock`, `defaultBlock`, and `directInsert` behavior, and scaffolded READMEs explain which nested constraints stay metadata-owned versus runtime-owned. — Thanks @imjlk!

- [aaa235e](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/aaa235e1e6b80001145f2332730fc86f57503735) Align scaffolded project conventions by treating `dev` as the primary generated entrypoint across first-party templates, clarifying that Query Loop scaffolds intentionally skip manual sync scripts, omitting the generated `packageManager` field for npm-based scaffolds, and removing the unused Query Loop `validator-toolkit.ts` placeholder. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [72e2ab1](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/72e2ab1b87c1f225b2542e9337077316a1dcf666) Keep the published `wp-typia` Bunli runtime compatible with Node fallback and generated project smoke flows by avoiding Bun chunk-name collisions during linked-runtime rebuilds without forcing the full CLI into a single-file bundle. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [3730b51](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/3730b516083defed2a07d4d72307a4d3f8e1a60a) Make the Node fallback CLI print a normal human-readable `--version` line by default, add earlier create/add preflight diagnostics for mistyped built-in templates and non-empty target directories, and fail `wp-typia add block` with install guidance before workspace dependency resolution errors. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [991ef3c](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/991ef3c20c6b8d1767309bb0432d3ac07baf76b2) Keep the split `wp-typia` Bunli runtime compatible with Linux reference-project migration smoke runs by using collision-safe asset names for the full runtime rebuild without regressing local help and skills command loading. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [938b9b0](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/938b9b08560640f76fd78e5966c9b6982c6a7fed) Add user-visible progress reporting for longer `wp-typia create` scaffold phases so fallback CLI runs and alternate-buffer create flows more clearly show template resolution, file generation, artifact seeding, finalization, and dependency installation work while scaffolding is in progress. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [5293151](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/529315196a151b54ddac2beb9157ec5fca1a42b5) Avoid split-chunk output collisions when rebuilding the linked Bunli runtime
  from generated example projects such as `my-typia-block`. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [fcec7f1](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/fcec7f1fd2dbb5716af706fb624621f73bfc9dfa) Improve human-readable `templates list` and `templates inspect` output with clearer flag capability hints, workspace alias discoverability, and logical layer summaries that do not expose raw internal template paths by default. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [65b8eb2](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/65b8eb2cf876eb73c8200da4fbcfd9fc30d2b5e0) Add the first-class `wp-typia add rest-resource <name>` workspace workflow so official workspace plugins can scaffold plugin-level typed REST resources with generated TypeScript contracts, validators, endpoint clients, React data hooks, PHP route starters, `sync-rest` inventory support, and matching add/doctor/help surfaces.
  
  Teach `@wp-typia/rest` endpoint execution to honor `requestLocation: "query-and-body"` so generated update clients can split query parameters and JSON bodies correctly. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [661c398](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/661c398f31a80293557bf6d1727c28abdb1b591d) Keep the repo-owned Bunli runtime split for canonical CLI startup paths while

  the root policy layer, making `format:check` a first-class CI gate, and aligning
  built-in scaffold package manifests on the same formatter version so generated
  projects no longer carry stale Prettier 2.x pins. — Thanks @imjlk!

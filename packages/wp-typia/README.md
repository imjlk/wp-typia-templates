# `wp-typia`

Canonical CLI package for `wp-typia`.

Use this package for new projects:

- `npx wp-typia create my-block`
- `bunx wp-typia create my-block`
- `curl -fsSL https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/releases/latest/download/install-wp-typia.sh | sh`
- `npx wp-typia create my-plugin --template workspace`
- `npx wp-typia create my-books --template query-loop --query-post-type book`

Extend an existing workspace with:

- `wp-typia add block counter-card --template basic`
- `wp-typia add integration-env local-smoke --wp-env --service docker-compose`
- `wp-typia add style callout-emphasis --block counter-card`
- `wp-typia add transform quote-to-counter --from core/quote --to counter-card`
- `wp-typia add binding-source hero-data`
- `wp-typia add binding-source hero-data --block counter-card --attribute headline`
- `wp-typia add rest-resource snapshots --namespace my-plugin/v1 --methods list,read,create`
- `wp-typia add ability review-workflow`
- `wp-typia add ai-feature brief-suggestions --namespace my-plugin/v1`
- `wp-typia add editor-plugin review-workflow --slot sidebar`
- `wp-typia add editor-plugin seo-notes --slot document-setting-panel`
- `wp-typia add hooked-block counter-card --anchor core/post-content --position after`

`wp-typia <project-dir>` remains available as a backward-compatible alias to
`wp-typia create <project-dir>` when `<project-dir>` is the only positional
argument.

Configuration files:

- `wp-typia` loads `~/.config/wp-typia/config.json`, `.wp-typiarc`, `.wp-typiarc.json`, then `package.json#wp-typia`; later sources override earlier sources
- `--config <path>` is an explicit override loaded after the default sources, relative to the current working directory unless absolute
- config files use a strict schema: unknown keys are errors rather than warnings or stripped values, so typos fail near the source config file
- object values are deep-merged, while arrays such as `mcp.schemaSources` replace earlier arrays instead of concatenating

Compatibility notes:

- `@wp-typia/project-tools` is the canonical programmatic project orchestration package
- the published CLI now ships built `dist-bunli` runtimes, and the canonical Node bin uses a Node-safe fallback runtime for non-TUI `create`/`add`/`migrate`, `doctor`, `sync`, `--version`, `--help`, and template inspection without requiring a locally installed Bun binary
- if `wp-typia --help` says `Runtime: Node fallback`, you are on that Bun-free path. You get human-readable help/output, common non-interactive project workflows, and lighter prompt behavior where interactive fallback is still supported
- when you request machine-readable output with `--format json`, CLI failures now include a stable `error.code` field so wrappers and CI can branch without parsing English text
- the stable machine-handled branching key is `error.code`. Structured context like `error.command`, `error.kind`, and `error.tag` may also be useful to consumers, while free-form text like `error.message`, `error.summary`, and `error.detailLines` stays human-facing guidance and can evolve without notice
- when that Node fallback prompts interactively, it intentionally stays lighter than the Bun/OpenTUI flow: numbered lists, option label/value matching, inline validation retries, and redraw commands for the current choices: `?` for the short reprint shortcut, `help` for the explicit redraw command, and `list` for users who expect option listing semantics
- Bunli-specific command surfaces such as `skills`, `completions`, and `mcp` still run through the built `dist-bunli/cli.js` artifact and require Bun when you use the npm package directly; if you want the full Bunli/OpenTUI runtime story without a local Bun install, prefer the standalone installer from the latest GitHub Release
- standalone release assets are published per platform together with checksum manifests and install scripts: `install-wp-typia.sh` for macOS/Linux and `install-wp-typia.ps1` for Windows
- internal runtime-bridge helper modules are implementation details; integrations
  should target the CLI or `@wp-typia/project-tools`, not CLI internals

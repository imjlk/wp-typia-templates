- [9952e4f](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/9952e4f4669dbc6e859906807ef872f9306d3367) Export validated JSON artifact helpers for scaffold `block.json` and `typia.manifest.json` boundaries, and update generated projects, examples, migration UI, and CLI tooling to prefer those runtime validators over raw `as` casts. — Thanks @imjlk!

- Updated dependencies: api-client (npm)@0.4.2

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-07

### Minor changes

- [5a8e531](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/5a8e531c09c3d95a9ac2cabb07487a83c9b0e3c3) Graduate generated-project runtime imports to `@wp-typia/block-runtime`, add
  supported `@wp-typia/block-runtime/blocks` and
  `@wp-typia/block-runtime/metadata-core` surfaces, and update scaffolded
  templates/examples to use them as the normative generated-project runtime and
  sync packages while keeping `@wp-typia/create` as the CLI package plus
  compatibility facade.
  
  Tighten the basic scaffold WordPress baseline by restoring a real
  `editorStyle` asset, renaming the legacy `version` attribute to
  `schemaVersion`, keeping `save.tsx` serialization stable when visibility is
  toggled, bumping generated plugin PHP minimums to 8.0, and changing the
  default scaffold namespace fallback from `create-block` to the normalized
  project slug. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [6937278](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/6937278f24003d31091953eed86433414b3ed42d) Add optional `check` verification mode to `@wp-typia/block-runtime/metadata-core`
  sync helpers so generated projects and repo examples can verify committed
  artifacts without rewriting them. Scaffolded `build` and `typecheck` scripts now
  fail on stale generated metadata instead of silently mutating tracked files,
  while `start`, `dev`, and explicit `sync-*` commands remain refresh-oriented. — Thanks @imjlk!

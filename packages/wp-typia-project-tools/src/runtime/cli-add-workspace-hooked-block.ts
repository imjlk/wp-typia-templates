/**
 * Add one `blockHooks` entry to an existing official workspace block.
 *
 * @param options Command options for the hooked-block workflow.
 * @param options.anchorBlockName Full block name that will anchor the insertion.
 * @param options.blockName Existing workspace block slug to patch.
 * @param options.cwd Working directory used to resolve the nearest official workspace.
 * Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
 * @param options.position Hook position to store in `block.json`.
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the normalized target block slug, anchor
 * block name, position, and owning project directory after `block.json` is written.
 * @throws {Error} When the command is run outside an official workspace, when
 * the target block is unknown, when required flags are missing, or when the
 * block already defines a hook for the requested anchor.

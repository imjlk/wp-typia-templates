- [7d1416b](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/7d1416b506c490f1c8775e6f8d985ae69846fd3c) Fixed generated AI ability scaffold clients to use WordPress script modules and supported combined query/body inputs in the opt-in typia.llm adapter. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.20.0 — 2026-04-24

### Minor changes

## 0.19.3 — 2026-04-23

- [fbf4476](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/fbf4476011ebd95b21ca29af0cf964adc26da611) Added: retrofit init planning and external template safety guards — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.19.2 — 2026-04-23

### Patch changes

- [f215f32](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/f215f3266fb781178cd0203bb380b6669de8550e) Split workspace REST resource scaffolding into focused source-emitter and anchor-repair helpers while preserving the public add command surface. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.19.1 — 2026-04-22

### Patch changes

- [b3f5346](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/b3f5346c22b0b1b9380db4498b51e8692880204b) Added stable machine-readable CLI error codes for structured `--format json` failures across the Node fallback and Bun runtime command surfaces. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [d5c5362](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/d5c536289cd391310bf7089a58de384948baf643) Add standalone `wp-typia` release assets and installers. GitHub Releases can now publish platform-specific standalone archives together with `install-wp-typia.sh` / `install-wp-typia.ps1`, and the installed CLI can resolve packaged scaffold/template support assets without requiring Bun to be preinstalled on the target machine. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [cccdd76](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/cccdd760553bcbb96c87b350d6814ef8778e91c1) Improved doctor scope messaging, add completion guidance, sync and dry-run help text, and missing bundled-artifact diagnostics across standalone CLI flows. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [1d1dd6e](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/1d1dd6ea664ec5ff7c6da65d8699ab76b8359317) Hardened interactive runtime detection, fallback cleanup behavior, and temporary wp-typia workspace lifecycle handling. — Thanks @imjlk!

- [1445631](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/1445631721f0ebb237b8bd60f9f8cbdab5ca8e8a) Attached template-family-aware grouped scaffold variable metadata while preserving the flat string view used by rendering and external template flows. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.19.0 — 2026-04-21

### Minor changes

- [bd575b8](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/bd575b866ac7f7860ef2e25ab3a7663fc0e4a9d0) Add alternate render target scaffold support for persistence-capable dynamic blocks. `wp-typia create` and `wp-typia add block` now accept `--alternate-render-targets <email,mjml,plain-text>` for persistence scaffolds and persistence-enabled compound scaffolds, emitting shared `render-targets.php` helpers plus per-target render entry files alongside the default web render boundary. — Thanks @imjlk!

### Patch changes

- [0938059](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/0938059eba177cb446bd05554ba5cd0ed1a1b5b8) Unify high-frequency create/add validation paths around shared helpers so built-in `--variant` errors, `externalLayerId` composition rules, and local `--external-layer-source` path failures surface the same messages across CLI entry points. Query Loop post-type validation now mentions the original offending input, and `wp-typia add block` explains when a provided name normalizes to an empty slug instead of falling back to a generic required-field error. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [0559810](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/055981091f996d6693dcce323e191e1f879ae127) Improve create/add/sync CLI ergonomics for preview-first and no-install workflows. `wp-typia create --dry-run` now defaults non-interactive answers without requiring an extra `--yes`, `wp-typia sync` fails early with install guidance when local dependencies like `tsx` are missing, and `wp-typia add ... --dry-run` can preview planned workspace file updates without mutating the real workspace. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [d2d0cd6](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/d2d0cd61b22cf4f6086609d342d9cd9beec189f4) Polish scaffold onboarding so create-time output and generated READMEs make `wp-typia doctor` easier to discover, keep sync notes shorter, and favor the default workspace quick-start path over more specialized first-run examples. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [849c750](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/849c7502911954796dc1e8ae13c6369de658313b) Expose hook-friendly InnerBlocks option helpers for generated compound containers.
  
  Generated compound parents and container children now export reusable `get*InnerBlocksPropsOptions()` helpers so projects can move to `useInnerBlocksProps` without manually reconstructing preset-driven `template`, `defaultBlock`, `templateLock`, `orientation`, `directInsert`, or `renderAppender` settings. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [da4ea2c](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/da4ea2c40e34548c8931a48b47cf886fb76d014e) Clarify compound nested block ownership so static child constraints stay metadata-owned.
  
  Generated compound parent and nested child editors now rely on `block.json` for static `allowedBlocks`, `parent`, and `ancestor` relationships, while `children.ts` stays focused on editor-only preset behavior such as `template`, `defaultBlock`, `orientation`, `templateLock`, and `directInsert`. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [b94f058](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/b94f058f79a967a31052d2c33a45b201a340d28e) Clarify template capability boundaries across create/add/help/onboarding flows. Query Loop discovery now explains that it is a create-time `core/query` variation scaffold rather than an `add block` family, explicit but inapplicable flags like `--with-migration-ui` and `--query-post-type` now surface visible warnings, and workspace guidance more consistently points users at the short `--template workspace` alias. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [b177c6b](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/b177c6b429753e7c05714efcdc0d66be980cb1f0) Validate compound child graphs before generated nested child scaffolds write files.
  
  Generated compound child add-flow scripts can now preview the resulting nested hierarchy with `--dry-run`, emit planned writes before mutating files, and fail early when existing or requested ancestor graphs are structurally invalid. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [4eb3ad0](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/4eb3ad064d6fa18839b7692bcb8ff6ac04e49091) Add compound scaffold InnerBlocks presets for richer nested authoring flows.
  
  Compound create and workspace add flows now accept `--inner-blocks-preset <freeform|ordered|horizontal|locked-structure>`, generated compound container code exposes preset-backed `orientation`, `templateLock`, `defaultBlock`, and `directInsert` behavior, and scaffolded READMEs explain which nested constraints stay metadata-owned versus runtime-owned. — Thanks @imjlk!

- [fcec7f1](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/fcec7f1fd2dbb5716af706fb624621f73bfc9dfa) Improve human-readable `templates list` and `templates inspect` output with clearer flag capability hints, workspace alias discoverability, and logical layer summaries that do not expose raw internal template paths by default. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [65b8eb2](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/65b8eb2cf876eb73c8200da4fbcfd9fc30d2b5e0) Add the first-class `wp-typia add rest-resource <name>` workspace workflow so official workspace plugins can scaffold plugin-level typed REST resources with generated TypeScript contracts, validators, endpoint clients, React data hooks, PHP route starters, `sync-rest` inventory support, and matching add/doctor/help surfaces.
  
  Teach `@wp-typia/rest` endpoint execution to honor `requestLocation: "query-and-body"` so generated update clients can split query parameters and JSON bodies correctly. — Thanks @imjlk!

- [9d60ecf](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/9d60ecf03431b281fb804d48b753ab5b5641051f) Remove built-in scaffold `types.ts.mustache` and `block.json.mustache` files now that structural artifacts are emitter-owned, keep the generator contract documented as “template bodies from Mustache, structural files from emitters”, and add guard tests so built-in template trees cannot regress back to shipping stale structural Mustache sources. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [f31b84b](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/f31b84be3bb4eea2583a610e4c96039f62fa290e) Move built-in scaffold `types.ts` and `block.json` generation onto the typed Phase 2 emitter path behind `BlockGeneratorService`, reuse the same structural artifact model for starter manifests, and document the new ownership split where structural files are emitter-owned while the remaining built-in scaffold files still come from Mustache templates. — Thanks @imjlk!
- [4ed3170](https://github.com/imjlk/wp-typia/commit/4ed31709b87ecc0f3fb7bd1524d40700cac44c82) Make built-in scaffold TS/TSX bodies emitter-owned alongside structural files, remove stale built-in TS/TSX Mustache sources, and document the narrowed Mustache ownership split. — Thanks @imjlk!
